# Counterpoint Writer
* The Counterpoint Writer is a program which allows you to create a species counterpoint in any species given a *cantus firmus*, or melody. This program is much like my 4 Part Creator but instead of writing stricly classical four-part scores, this program creates accompaniment for a given voice line which would be used in the 16th Century as a way to teach students how to play a a keyboard instrument (such as the harpsichord or piano). There are 5 difference species of counterpoint which are all implemented in the program. You can save counterpoints as MIDI files so you can share the sweet sounds of the 16th Century.
* The Counterpoint Writer is definitely a more "constant" version of the 4 Part Writer, as this Counterpoint Writer prcoedurally generates species counterpoint using more strict measures, assuring you'll nearly get the same counterpoint each time you try and write a counterpoint with a given melody. This program shows off similar ideas as the 4 Part Writer - that I can make applications very customizable on terms of functionality and apply an abstract idea such as Music Theory into a more absolute idea like programming.
