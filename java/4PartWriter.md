# 4 Part Writer
* The 4 Part Writer is a program which allows you to create classical four-part scores using principles that you'd learn while taking Music Theory I. You can change up settings so you could make scores as long as you want, set certain chords to certain places, and provide voicings for certain parts, switch between major/minor, apply only certain stylistic practices, and much more! All scores created include a roman-numeral analysis. It also includes various other tools like interval calculators, chord builders, and more! This is definitely a must for anyone taking Music Theory I in the future.
* The 4 Part Writer is definitely one of the more intense programs I've created. I originally made it for myself as a challenge during my time learning Java. It worked for the most part, but it still had tons of issues. I finally decided to complete the project fully and integrate it into a full-blown graphical application, as well as include some extra tools that would've been handy in my time taking Music Theory I. This program definitely shows off my ability of making graphical components in Java, as well as my ability to implemenet abstract concepts like Music Theory into an absolute idea like computer programming.
