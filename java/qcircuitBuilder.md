# QCircuit Builder
* The QCircuit Builder is a program that allows you to build Quantum Circuits in a very similar fashion to IBM's Quantum Experience program. Simulations can be run through random number generators with a weight to "measure" the simulated qbits, or you can just view the predicted output(s) of our circuit, whichever you choose. It's also possible to export your circuit in QASM, so you could even try running your circuit on an actual Quantum Computer!
* Making the QCircuit Builder was definitely a challenge. I had to become very comfortable with matrix operations and figure out a way to apply those in context with qbits. I also had to learn tons upon tons of mathematics involved with quantum computing to deliver the best experience I could for users. It's by far the most mathematically-challenging project I've worked on.
