Below are all of the projects that I'm most proud of making that are based in Java. 

# Music Applications
* [Counterpoint Writer](https://master10104.github.io/java/counterpointWriter.html) - Beloved by Music Theory I students, a graphical application that prompts a user to create a *cantus firmus* and generates a counterpoint of a specified species (1st - 5th). You can save the counterpoints generated and open it again later. 
* [4 Part Writer](https://master10104.github.io/java/4PartWriter.html) - Another beloved by Music Theory I students, a graphical application which writes classical 4-part scores. You can save these scores as MIDI files so you can share your *almost* original score.

# Quantum Compuational Models
* [QCircuit Builder](https://master10104.github.io/java/qcircuitBuilder.html) - A graphical application which allows you to build quantum circuits similarly to how you would using IBM's Quantum Experience program.
