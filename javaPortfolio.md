Return to [portfolio](https://master10104.github.io/index.md).

Below are all of the projects that I'm most proud of making that are based in Java. 

# Music Applications
* [Counterpoint Writer](https://master10104.github.io/java/counterpointWriter.md) - Beloved by Music Theory I students, a graphical application that prompts a user to create a *cantus firmus* and generates a counterpoint of a specified species (1st - 5th). You can save the counterpoints generated and open it again later. 
* [4 Part Writer](https://master10104.github.io/java/4PartWriter.md) - Another beloved by Music Theory I students, a graphical application which writes classical 4-part scores. You can save these scores as MIDI files so you can share your *almost* original score.

# Quantum Compuational Models
* [Circuit Model](https://master10104.github.io/java/circuitModel.md) - A graphical application which allows you to build quantum circuits similarly to how you would using IBM's Quantum Experience program. Simulations can done through a simple random number generator in large sequences with a weight based on the state of each qbit **or** through predictions, whichever you'd rather do.
