# master10104

I am a 17 year old software developer that has about 3 total years of experience in the field.

I have 3 years of experience in Java, 2 years of experience working in Node.js, and 2 years of experience in Lua.

I began my programming career approximately 3 years ago, where I became fluent in Java after taking an AP Computer Science course. After studying for approximately a year in school, I began learning both Javascript and Lua. I have been continuing my work comfortably ever since.

I have a particular interest in specific implementations of programming which include, but are definitely not limited to, Music Theory, Quantum Computational Models, and Discord Bots.
